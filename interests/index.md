## [Tai Chi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi)
* I started to practice Tai Chi in 2012 and I have been the twelfth generation of the Chen style Tai Chi since 2017. I also do other traditional Chinese martial arts, including long-tassel sword and [Pi Gua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piguaquan).

## Sports
* Tennis: I have played tennis for three years. Santa Barbara always has nice weather for this sport!
* Snowboarding: I started snowboarding a year ago and hope to improve mu skills and visit more mountains!
* Racket ball and more.....
