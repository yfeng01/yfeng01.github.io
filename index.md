Hello! Iâ€™m Yichen Feng, a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate at [Department of Statistics & Applied Probability](http://www.pstat.ucsb.edu){:target="_blank"}, University of California, Santa Barbara, under the supervision of Professor Jean-Pierre Fouque.

I'm interested in **financial mathematics**, including **stochastic differential games**, **mean field games**, **systematic risk** and **portfolio allocation**.

Before joining UCSB, I received my M.S. in Financial Engineering at [Temple University](https://www.fox.temple.edu/about-fox/){:target="_blank"} in 2016. I did my B.S. at School of the Gifted Young, [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/Schools.htm){:target="_blank"} in 2016, with a major in Statistics.
